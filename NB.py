# NB.py should take the following parameters:
#   the training file,
#   the test file,
#   the file where the parameters of the resulting model will be saved, and
#   the output file where you will write predictions made by the classifier on the test data (one example per line).
# The last line in the output file should list the overall accuracy of the classifier on the test data.
